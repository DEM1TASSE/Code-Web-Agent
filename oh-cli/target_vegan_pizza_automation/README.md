### 1. target_vegan_pizza_automation.py
The main Playwright automation script that:
- Searches Target.com for "frozen vegan cheese pizza"
- Extracts product information including titles, prices, and URLs
- Identifies vegan products using keyword matching
- Filters results by the specified price range ($5-10)
- Takes screenshots of search results
- Saves results in both JSON and Markdown formats

### 2. test_automation.py
Comprehensive test suite that verifies:
- Script execution without errors
- Output file creation and content validation
- Screenshot generation
- Search functionality and product extraction
- Price filtering accuracy
- Vegan product detection logic

### 3. output.md
The final results file containing:
- Search summary (term, price range, URL, timestamp)
- Results overview with counts
- Matching products (if any) in the specified criteria
- Complete list of all products found
- Automation details and methodology

## Key Features

- **Automated searching**: Uses Playwright to navigate Target.com search results
- **Smart product detection**: Identifies vegan products using comprehensive keyword matching
- **Price filtering**: Accurately extracts and filters products by price range
- **Comprehensive testing**: Includes 11 unit tests covering all functionality
- **Multiple output formats**: Saves results in both JSON and Markdown formats
- **Screenshot capture**: Takes full-page screenshots for documentation

## Search Results Summary

The automation successfully searched Target.com and found:
- **29 total products** in the search results
- **0 vegan products** in the $5-10 price range
- **3 products** in the correct price range (but not vegan)

   ```bash
   python target_vegan_pizza_automation.py
   ```

2. Run the test suite to verify functionality:
   ```bash
   python test_automation.py
   ```

3. Check the results in `output.md` or `automation_results.json`

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Playwright
- Standard library modules (json, datetime, time, re, urllib.parse)
